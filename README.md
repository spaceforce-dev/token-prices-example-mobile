Uniswap price challenge

We would love for you to whip up a quick sleek UI to display the live price of Uniswap trading pairs using your preffered IOS development framework.

Bonus points for it live updating as the price changes. (usually a trade happens every 30 seconds or so)

Setup and run example script:

npm i

npm run example
